This is a basic front to back mini app that I used to play around with
Flask and python package psyco2pg to CRUD to/from my postgres DB.

You will need certain packages or libraries such as psyco2pg, Flask, requests.
You will need to have PostgreSQL installed on your computer with user and DB set up.

Summary: This app will take user input from the Flask front end: a soccer player and his/her statistics. The app will then either commit this add/update operation to the table, or it will delete if necessary. CRUD operations are performed by various routes offered by the Flask application.
